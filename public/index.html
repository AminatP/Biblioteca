One copy sold at auction in New York for $6.166 million in 2001, and five years later, another copy fetched $5.153 million. In 2016 a set of the first four editions of Shakespeare’s first folios fetched $3.68 million at auction. That included a first edition of the First Folio that had previously not been known to exist.</p>

							<h4 class="card-title">Babylonian Talmund</h4>
							<p class="card-text">The Babylonian Talmund is one of only 14 complete multi volume sets from the early 16th century still in existence.
								The buyer attempted to remain anonymous, but reports say the book was purchased in 2015 by billionaire Leon Black, an investor, art collector and founder of Apollo Global Management.
								The book is the most expensive piece of Judaica to ever sell at auction. Previously, it had been sitting at Westminster Abbey for some 400 years, where apparently no one knew how valuable it was.</p>

							<h4 class="card-title">The Codex of Leicester</h4>
							<p class="card-text">Leonardo da Vinci’s Codex of Leicester, also known as the Codex Hammer, is the most expensive book ever sold. The 72-page linen manuscript includes Leonardo’s thoughts, theories and observations of the world, like the movement of water, fossils and the luminosity of the moon.
								It sold for $30.8 million in 1994 to Bill Gates, who wasn’t yet the richest person in the world — although he was certainly wealthy. After buying the Codex, he had it digitally scanned, then released some images as screen savers and wallpapers for Windows 98 Plus. That’s quite a journey for a book written in 1510.</p>

							<h4 class="card-title">Ptolemy’s Geographia Cosmographia</h4>
							<p class="card-text">Ptolemy, who lived around 100 AD, contributed some of the most influential scientific findings in history. Though the printing press wasn’t invented in his lifetime, he hand drew a manual of maps that portrayed the world as he knew it at that time. The Geographia maps today are wildly inaccurate, but remain an important resource on the European view of the world in that time period. His model of a geocentric universe, one where the sun and planets revolve around the earth, outlived him and was considered fact for 1,400 years.
